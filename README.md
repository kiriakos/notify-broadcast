# Broadcast desktop notifications via notify-send and dbus

`notify-broadcast` can send broadcst notifications via `notify-send` to all 
users on a desktop session

It utilizes `notify-send` and DBUS for this and should be usable with most 
freedesktop implementations that can display `notify-send` notifications.
Please note that _the author only uses GNOME_ though and does not guarantee
this to work in any other DE.
